# Vendored: @earendil-works/pi-agent-core

`src/` is a verbatim copy of upstream `packages/agent/src` at that commit. This
package is consumed as the Bun workspace `@local-studio/harness` from
`services/agent-runtime`; nothing else in the repository may import it.

## Rule: no upstream tracking

This directory does not track upstream. There is no sync script and no
automatic update. Upstream changes land here only as hand cherry-picks, each
reviewed and recorded below with the upstream commit it came from. Bumping the
version table above without a full re-copy and a fresh review is not allowed.

## Dependencies

`package.json` pins exactly what upstream declares at 0.84.3: `@earendil-works/pi-ai`,
`diff`, `ignore`, `typebox`, `yaml`, and `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry`.

`pi-telemetry` was kept as a dependency rather than replaced by a local no-op:
`src/index.ts` and `src/harness/telemetry.ts` re-export ~30 types and four
runtime symbols (`createTypedSpanStarter`, `defineTelemetrySchema`,
`InMemoryTelemetryContext`, `NOOP_TELEMETRY_CONTEXT`) from it, the package has
no dependencies of its own, and it is already installed transitively by
`@earendil-works/pi-ai`. A shim would have been a larger diff than the import.

## Local modifications

### `src/`

`src/harness/**`, `src/*.ts` and `src/harness/tools/{read,write,edit,edit-diff,bash,image,path-utils,file-mutation-queue,tool-context,index}.ts`
are byte-identical to upstream, except `src/harness/tools/index.ts`, which additionally exports the three tools
below.

### Additions from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (same repository, `packages/coding-agent/src`, same commit, MIT)

Vendored on 2026-09-03 when the runtime dropped its dependency on the pi-coding-agent SDK (MET-914 W3b). Files
under `src/providers/core/` and `src/providers/utils/{abort,json,text,management-http,pi-user-agent}.ts` are verbatim
copies; the rest are adaptations, each with a header note:

| File | Upstream | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `src/harness/tools/grep.ts`, `find.ts`, `ls.ts` | `core/tools/{grep,find,ls}.ts` | On the harness tool contract (`ExecutionToolContext`): TUI renderers, `wrapToolDefinition`, pluggable `*Operations` removed; paths through the execution env; binaries from PATH (`binaries.ts`, local) instead of `utils/tools-manager.ts` downloads. Names, schemas, output unchanged. |
| `src/providers/core/{model-runtime,auth-storage,resolve-config-value,model-config,models-store,provider-composer,remote-catalog-provider,runtime-credentials}.ts` | `core/*` | Verbatim. |
| `src/providers/config.ts` | `config.ts` | Local shim: only `getAgentDir()` and `VERSION`, the two symbols the modules above import. |
| `src/providers/utils/paths.ts` | `utils/paths.ts` | `markPathIgnoredByCloudSync` (and its `cross-spawn` dependency) dropped. |
| `src/providers/utils/shell.ts` | `utils/shell.ts` | Only `getShellConfig` kept (what `resolve-config-value` needs). |
| `src/providers/index.ts` | — | Local: the `@local-studio/harness/providers` entry (`ModelRuntime`, `AuthStorage`). |

Not vendored from pi-coding-agent: `model-registry.ts` (extension-facing facade), `auth-guidance.ts` (CLI help text),
`utils/child-process.ts` (only needed by the dropped helper). `proper-lockfile` was added to `package.json` for
`auth-storage.ts`.

### `test/` (ported from vitest to `bun:test`)

Kept (the tests that protect the behaviour the fork relies on — agent loop,
harness scaffold, session tree and JSONL repository, compaction, tools):

- `test/agent-loop.test.ts`
- `test/harness/agent-harness-scaffold.test.ts`
- `test/harness/compaction.test.ts`, `test/harness/branch-summarization.test.ts`
- `test/harness/reducer.test.ts`
- `test/harness/tools.test.ts`
- `test/harness/session/{context,jsonl,jsonl-codec,jsonl-storage,memory,search}.test.ts`
- `test/harness/session-test-utils.ts` (helper)

Changes applied to every kept file: `from "vitest"` → `from "bun:test"`.
File-specific changes:

- `test/harness/branch-summarization.test.ts`, `test/harness/session/context.test.ts`:
  `import type { AgentMessage } from "@earendil-works/pi-agent-core"` →
  the relative `src/index.ts`, so the tests type against the vendored copy and
  not the npm package that `pi-coding-agent` still pulls in.
- `test/harness/session/jsonl.test.ts`: `vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ["Date"] })`
  + `vi.setSystemTime(...)` / `vi.useRealTimers()` → Bun's `setSystemTime(...)`
  / `setSystemTime()` (Bun's `vi` has no `setSystemTime`).

Dropped: `e2e.test.ts` (real model), `agent.test.ts`, `proxy.test.ts`
(`vi.stubGlobal`), `telemetry.test.ts` (`expectTypeOf`), and the
`events`, `nodejs-env`, `prompt-templates`, `resource-formatting`, `skills`,
`system-prompt`, `truncate` harness suites — upstream unit coverage of code
the fork does not customise. Upstream `docs/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`scripts/` and the vitest configs were not copied.

### Added files (not upstream)

`package.json` (workspace manifest; also exposes the `./session/state` subpath so the agent-runtime SQLite session backend can reuse `SessionState` — no `src/` change), `tsconfig.json` (editor-only; extends the
agent-runtime config with `target: ES2022` because
`src/harness/session/testing/conformance.ts` uses BigInt literals), this file.

### Consumer-side changes made for the vendored code

- `services/agent-runtime/tsconfig.json`: `allowImportingTsExtensions`;
  `tsconfig.build.json`: `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` — upstream imports
  carry `.ts` extensions. `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` type-checks the vendored
  sources but does not emit them (they resolve through `node_modules`); the
  runtime artifact is `dist/standalone.mjs`, which bundles them.
- `services/agent-runtime/bunfig.toml`: `linker = "hoisted"` — Bun's default
  isolated layout for workspaces would move `@earendil-works/*` out of the flat
  `node_modules` tree that `bundle-agent-runtime` and the tsconfig `paths` rely on.

## Cherry-pick log

None yet.
